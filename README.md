# seventy-one

A portable implementation of the number 71 in Clojure and ClojureScript.

## Obtention

`[com.gfredericks/seventy-one "0.1.3"]`

## Compatibility notes

As of release `0.1.1` seventy-one requires clojure 1.7, as its source
is packaged in the new `.cljc` file format.

## Usage

``` clojure
(require '[com.gfredericks.seventy-one :refer [seventy-one]])

(defn business-logic
  [customer-count]
  ;; add 71 to customer-count
  (+ customer-count seventy-one))
```
